# Untitled Ludum Dare 44 Project

**The gist:** Strategy RPG where basic units can be sacrificed for a pip of colored mana which can activate special abilities on Named Hero Units?

This is an as of yet unnamed [Ludum Dare 44][ld] game by [Sakurina][skrn] and [woofycakes][woof]. The theme of the jam is **"your life is currency"**.

## Tools used

* [LÃ–VE][love], a Lua-based multiplatform 2D game framework.
* [anim8][anim8] for sprite animations.
* [Lovebird][lovebird] for sane debugging.
* [Lume][lume] for lots of useful helper functions.
* [classic][classic] for easy class creation.
